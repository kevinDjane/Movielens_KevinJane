# Preface - Introduction {#preface}

The purpose of this capstone project is to create a movie recommender system to achieve the
[Professional Certificate of the Data Science](https://www.edx.org/es/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) 
courses taught by Harvard University.

The data science job market is exponencially growing being in the 
[top 3 of jobs most sought after](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbeshumanresourcescouncil/2021/05/20/hr-leaders-share-14-in-demand-skills-employers-want-in-2021/?sh=44ba748d1e45), 
this can allow us to infer that the world is giving so much importance to open data than 
it was years ago, recognizing the potential of data analysis and prediction models for 
the global social-economic development.

I as an undergraduate economics student, being passionate about data, being able to manipulate 
data with R facilitates doing data analyses. 
Also, predictive models are essential to our, which become more time-efficient with R.

This project is made with the purpose of creating a recommender system using the [MovieLens database](https://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m-README.html)

The dataset used in this project is a version of MovieLens that contains **10000054 movies ratings**. The data is 
divided in two parts, 9 million are used for training and 1 million for validation.
In the training database, there are **69878 users** and **10677 movies**, divided in **20 different genres**, 
such as Action, Adventure, Horror, Drama, Thriller and so on.

In this case, our goal is trying to minimize the [**RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)]{#RMSE} at least to **0.86549** (RMSE <= **0.86549**)

# Initial code provided by edX.

dl <- tempfile()
download.file("http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-10m.zip", dl)

ratings <- fread(text = gsub("::", "\t", 
                             readLines(unzip(dl, "ml-10M100K/ratings.dat"))),
                 col.names = c("userId", "movieId", "rating", "timestamp"))

movies <- str_split_fixed(
  readLines(unzip(dl, "ml-10M100K/movies.dat")), "\\::", 3)
colnames(movies) <- c("movieId", "title", "genres")

# if using R 4.0 or later:
movies <- as.data.frame(movies) %>% 
  mutate(movieId = as.numeric(movieId),
         title = as.character(title),
         genres = as.character(genres))


movielens <- left_join(ratings, movies, by = "movieId")

# Validation set will be 10% of MovieLens data
set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding") # if using R 3.5 or earlier, use `set.seed(1)`
test_index <- createDataPartition(y = movielens$rating, 
                                  times = 1, p = 0.1, 
                                  list = FALSE)
edx <- movielens[-test_index,]
temp <- movielens[test_index,]

# Make sure userId and movieId in validation set are also in edx set
validation <- temp %>% 
  semi_join(edx, by = "movieId") %>%
  semi_join(edx, by = "userId")

# Add rows removed from validation set back into edx set
removed <- anti_join(temp, validation)
edx <- rbind(edx, removed)
```

The MovieLnens database were divided in two parts, one part is for model training that is called ```edx```, 
and the other one that is for the final model validation and it is called ```validation```.

The main idea is that, with the ```edx``` database we are going to train models, and select the best among them.

And then, we are going to test the best model with the ```validation``` database.

For that purpose, we have to divide ```edx``` database in ```train_set``` and ```test_set```. ```train_set``` 
is used to create all the models and ```test_set``` is used to prove how nice those models works, 
and the best among them, is used to test it with the ```validation``` database.

```{r load_data_2, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
# Test_set set will be 10% of Edx data
test_index_2 <- createDataPartition(y = edx$rating, 
                                    times = 1, p = 0.1, 
                                    list = FALSE)
train_set <- edx[-test_index_2,]
temp_2 <- edx[test_index_2,]

# Make sure userId and movieId in test_set set are also in train_set
test_set <- temp_2 %>% 
  semi_join(train_set, by = "movieId") %>%
  semi_join(train_set, by = "userId")

# Add rows removed from test_set set back into train_set
removed_2 <- anti_join(temp_2, test_set)
train_set <- rbind(train_set, removed_2)
```


## Initial data Exploration {#InDatExp}

### A first look

In this project, we divided the 10 million database in two parts: one is called ```edx```, that contains 
**9,000,055** for training and the other one is ```validation```, that contains **999,999** for the validation phase.

Finally, for training all the models, we divided the ```edx``` database in two parts: one is 
called ```train_set```, that contains **8,100,067** for training and the other one is ```test_set```, 
that contains **899,988** for the validation phase.

The initial variables/columns used in the databases (edx, validation, train_set and test_set) are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item userId <integer>: Unique identification number for each user.
  \item movieId <numeric>: Unique identification number for each movie.
  \item rating <numeric>: Rating of one movie by one user. Ratings are made on a 5-Star scale with half-star
increments.
  \item timestamp <integer>: Timestamp for one specific rating provided by one user.
  \item title <character>: Title of each movie including the year of the release.
  \item genres <character>: List of pipe-separated of genre of each movie.
\end{itemize}

### Edx database

The ```edx``` database contains **9,000,055** rows with **71567** different users and **10681** movies with rating
score between 0.5 and 5. There is no missing values (0 or NA).

**Edx database**

```{r Edx database, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
edx %>% 
  summarize(Users = n_distinct(userId),
            Movies = n_distinct(movieId))
```

**Missing Values per Variable on Edx database**

```{r Missing Values per Column_edx, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
sapply(edx, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

### Validation Database

The ```validation``` database contains **999,999** rows with **68534** different users and **9809** movies with rating
score between 0.5 and 5. There is no missing values (0 or NA).

**Validation database**

```{r Validation database, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
validation %>% 
  summarize(Users = n_distinct(userId),
              Movies = n_distinct(movieId))
```

**Missing Values per Variable on Validation database**

```{r Missing Values per Column on Validation, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
sapply(validation, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

### Train_Set

The ```train_set``` database contains **8,100,067** rows with **69878** different users and **10677** movies with rating
score between 0.5 and 5. There is no missing values (0 or NA).

**Train_set database**

```{r Train_set database, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
train_set %>% 
  summarize(Users = n_distinct(userId),
              Movies = n_distinct(movieId))
```

**Missing Values per Variable on Train_set database**

```{r Missing Values per Column_train, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
sapply(train_set, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```

### Test_Set

The ```train_set``` database contains **899,988** rows with **68052** different users and **9728** movies with rating
score between 0.5 and 5. There is no missing values (0 or NA).

**Test_set database**

```{r Test_set database, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
test_set %>% 
  summarize(Users = n_distinct(userId),
              Movies = n_distinct(movieId))
```

**Missing Values per Variable on Test_set database**

```{r Missing Values per Column_test, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
sapply(test_set, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
```


## Wrangling Data Process {#Wrangling}

After the initial data exploration, we can observe two things that we can change to make a better analysis.
The first is that the variable ```title``` contains the year where the movie was released. We can extract 
the year and the month where the movie was released. This could be very important to make a precise prediction of 
the movie rating.
The second one is that the variable ```timestamp``` has a date format that we cannot read or use for a more precise
analysis.


The wrangling and processing data phase is construct by these steps:

1. Convert ```timestamp``` variable to a more readable date format;

```{r, echo=TRUE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
# edx database
edx$date <- as.POSIXct(edx$timestamp, 
                       origin="1970-01-01")

# validation database
validation$date <- as.POSIXct(validation$timestamp, 
                              origin="1970-01-01")

# train_set database
train_set$date <- as.POSIXct(train_set$timestamp, 
                             origin="1970-01-01")

# test_set database
test_set$date <- as.POSIXct(test_set$timestamp, 
                            origin="1970-01-01")
```

2. Extract the month and the year from the last step and we convert the columns into the desired data type, i.e, ```yearofRate``` should be numeric;

```{r, echo=TRUE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
# edx database
edx$yearOfRate <- format(edx$date,"%Y")
edx$yearOfRate <- as.numeric(edx$yearOfRate)
edx$monthOfRate <- format(edx$date,"%m")
edx$monthOfRate <- as.numeric(edx$monthOfRate)

# validation database
validation$yearOfRate <- format(validation$date,"%Y")
validation$yearOfRate <- as.numeric(validation$yearOfRate)
validation$monthOfRate <- format(validation$date,"%m")
validation$monthOfRate <- as.numeric(validation$monthOfRate)

# train_set database
train_set$yearOfRate <- format(train_set$date,"%Y")
train_set$yearOfRate <- as.numeric(train_set$yearOfRate)
train_set$monthOfRate <- format(train_set$date,"%m")
train_set$monthOfRate <- as.numeric(train_set$monthOfRate)

# test_set database
test_set$yearOfRate <- format(test_set$date,"%Y")
test_set$yearOfRate <- as.numeric(test_set$yearOfRate)
test_set$monthOfRate <- format(test_set$date,"%m")
test_set$monthOfRate <- as.numeric(test_set$monthOfRate)
```

3. Extract the release year for each movie from the title;

```{r, echo=TRUE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
# edx database
edx <- edx %>% 
  mutate(release = as.numeric(str_sub(title,-5,-2)))

# validation database
validation <- validation %>% 
  mutate(release = as.numeric(str_sub(title,-5,-2)))

# train_set database
train_set <- train_set %>% 
  mutate(release = as.numeric(str_sub(title,-5,-2)))

# test_set database
test_set <- test_set %>% 
  mutate(release = as.numeric(str_sub(title,-5,-2)))
```

4. Then, we remove the unnecessary columns on the databases.

In this particular case, we remove ```timestamp``` and ```date``` because we already separated those variables into new columns, i.e, ```yearofRate```, ```monthofRate```, etc.
So, ```timestamp``` and ```date``` are redundant variables and we are not gonna use it for this project.

```{r, echo=TRUE,results='hide',message=FALSE}
# edx database
edx <- edx %>% 
  select(-timestamp, -date)

# validation database
validation <- validation %>% 
  select(-timestamp, -date)

# train_set database
train_set <- train_set %>% 
  select(-timestamp, -date)

# test_set database
test_set <- test_set %>% 
  select(-timestamp, -date)
```

These steps will increases the size of all databases (edx, validation, train_set and test_set).

After processing the data, every database looks like this:

**Processed database**

```{r Processed datadabases, echo= TRUE, results='hold', message=FALSE, fig.pos="H"}
head(edx, 5)
```

## Post Data Processed - Data Exploration {#DatExp2}

After  variables/columns used in every database (edx, validation, train_set and test_set) are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item userId <integer>: Unique identification number for each user.
  \item movieId <numeric>: Unique identification number for each movie.
  \item rating <numeric>: Rating of one movie by one user. Ratings are made on a 5-Star scale with half-star.
  \item title <character>: Title of each movie including the year of the release.
  \item genres <character>: List of pipe-separated of genre of each movie.
  \item yearOfRate <numeric>: Year of rating of one movie by one user.
  \item monthOfRate <numeric>: Month of rating of one movie by one user.
  \item release <numeric>: Year of when the movie was released.
\end{itemize}

In the next histogram, we can see that there are more frequency in positives votes, maybe for 3 or greater than 3 ```(ratings => 3)```. Based on this, we can inference
that every user are more used to vote when they liked the movies.

```{r rating distribution}
ggplot(train_set, aes(x = rating)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", bins = 10.5)+ xlab("Rating")+ylab("Frequency")
```

After seeing the first histogram, we can allow as to create a criteria about ratings.

We can say that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item If rating is in between 0.5 and 2 (0.5<=rating=>2), the vote is negative.
  \item If rating is in between 2.5 and 3.5 (2.5<=rating=>3.5), the vote is indifferent.
  \item If rating is in between 4 and 5 (4<=rating=>5), the vote is positive.
\end{itemize}

This is because usually when we don't like a movie, we vote with a very low rating, when we are indifferent, we try to be as 
impartial as we can, so we vote impartially, and if we like it, we rate it positively.

We can try seeing it better with another plot.

First we can create a dataset where it contains the year of rate, the type of vote that we mentioned and the rating.

```{r}
tOfVote <- train_set %>% 
  mutate(t_vote = ifelse(rating<2.5, "Negative Vote",
                            ifelse(rating>2&rating<4, "Indifferent Vote",
                                   "Positive Vote"))) %>%
  select(year=yearOfRate, t_vote, rating)
tOfVote %>% count(t_vote)
```

And finally we plot the rating distribution.

```{r}
ggplot(tOfVote, aes(x = rating, fill = t_vote , colour = t_vote)) + 
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", bins = 10) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1")
```

The next histogram can allow as to infer that in the 2000's the people vote the most.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
train_set$yearOfRate %>%
  hist(main="Frequency of Ratings over Years", 
       xlab="Years")
```

We can also try to plot the mean distribution of rating.
We use the same criteria of before.

```{r}
tOfVote %>%
  filter(t_vote %in% 
           c('Negative Vote','Indifferent Vote', 'Positive Vote'))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x=year,fill=t_vote, y = mean(rating))) + 
  geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity")+
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Average") + 
  ggtitle("Mean Rating Distribution by Type of Vote") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Set1")
```

These 2 graphs that we did, had the purpose of trying to let us know on what period of years, the people liked the most 
those movies based on the criteria that we made on ratings.

# Modeling {#Modeling}

As we mentioned before on the [Data preparation]{#Dataprep} section, we are going to use the ```train_set``` to train all the models, and the best one
is going to be used to test it with the ```validation``` database in the [final section]{#Validation}.

## Loss Function - RMSE {#RMSE}

The loss function in this project is the Root Mean Squared Error, mentioned in the 
["Introduction to Data Science" by Rafael A. Irizarry](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/large-datasets.html#recommendation-systems).
This function can be interpret similarly to a standard deviation: "it is the typical error we make when predicting a movie rating". If our RMSE is greater than 1, it is not good.

Like I mentioned before, our goal in this project is to make our **RMSE** that should be at least equal or lower than **0.86549**.

```{r RSME_formula}
RMSE <- function(true_ratings = NULL, predicted_ratings = NULL) {
  sqrt(mean((true_ratings - predicted_ratings)^2))
}
```   

$$\mbox{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{u,i}^{}(\hat{y}_{u,i}-y_{u,i})^{2}}$$

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $y_{u,i}$ is the rating for movie $i$ by user $u$ denoting our prediction $\hat{y}_{u,i}$
  \item $N$ is the number of user/movies combination
  \item The sum is occurring over all these combination
\end{itemize}

## Naive Model - A first model. {#FModel}

We can start by building the simplest possible recommendation system: by predicting the rating for all movies regardless of user.

$$Y_{u,i} = \hat{\mu} + \varepsilon_{u,i}$$

Where $\varepsilon_{i,u}$ is the independent errors sampled from the same distribution centered at 0 and $\hat{\mu}$ is the average(mean).

We know that the estimate that minimizes the RMSE is the least squares estimate of $\hat{\mu}$ and, in this case, is the average of all ratings.

```{r muhat}
muhat <- mean(train_set$rating) # Average rating of all movies
muhat
```

If we predict all unknown ratings with $\hat{\mu}$ we obtain the following RMSE

```{r}
naive_rmse <- RMSE(test_set$rating, muhat)
naive_rmse
results <- data.frame(model="Naive Model", RMSE=naive_rmse) # We create a database of the results
```

The RMSE in this case, where we use the ```test_set``` database, it is **1.061135**. This result is a little bit further from our goal, where our RMSE should be 
at least lower than **0.86549**.

## Movie Effect Model {#MModel}

Based on the Movielens data base, we know that movies are rated differently, we can make a more rigorous model by adding the term $b_i$ to represent average ranking
for movie $_i$. In statistics books refer to $b$s as effects, but in the Netflix challenge papers, they refer to them as ‚Äúbias,‚Äù thus the $b$ notation.

The formula for this model should look like this:

$$Y_{u,i} = \hat{\mu} + b_i + \epsilon_{u,i}$$
Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\varepsilon_{i,u}$ is the independent errors sampled from the same distribution centered at 0.
  \item $\hat{\mu}$ is the average(mean).
  \item And $b_i$ is just the average of $Y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu}$ for each movie $i$
\end{itemize}

```{r}
muhat <- mean(train_set$rating) # Average rating of all movies
muhat
```

```{r}
movie_avgs <- train_set %>% # Average rating by movie
  group_by(movieId) %>%
  summarize(b_i = mean(rating - muhat))
```

We can see that these estimates vary considerably

```{r}
qplot(b_i, data = movie_avgs, bins = 10, color = I("black"))
```

Now, let's see how much our prediction improves since $\hat{y}_{u,i} = \hat{\mu} + b_i$:

```{r}
movie_eff_pred <- muhat + test_set %>%
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  pull(b_i)
rmse_movie <- RMSE(movie_eff_pred, test_set$rating)
rmse_movie
results <- results %>% # We add the result to the results database
  add_row(model="Movie Effect Model", RMSE=rmse_movie)
```

The RMSE in this case is **0.9441568**. It much better than the first model. Yet, we didn't reach our RMSE goal (lower than **0.86549**).

## Movie + User Effects Model {#MUModel}

First of all, we want to watch the average rating for user $u$ for those that have rated 100 or more movies.

```{r}
train_set %>%
  group_by(userId) %>%
  filter(n()>=100) %>%
  summarize(b_u = mean(rating)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(b_u)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, color = "black")
```

Based on this, we can infer that we can improve our model by using the next formula:

$$Y_{u,i} = \hat{\mu} + b_i + b_u + \epsilon_{u,i}$$

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\varepsilon_{i,u}$ is the independent errors sampled from the same distribution centered at 0. 
  \item $\hat{\mu}$ is the average(mean). 
  \item $b_i$ is the average of $Y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu}$ for each movie $i$.
  \item $b_u$ is the average of $Y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu} - \hat{b}_i$; is a user-specific effect.
\end{itemize}

```{r}
muhat <- mean(train_set$rating) # Average rating of all movies
muhat
```

```{r}
user_avgs <- train_set %>% # Average rating by user
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  group_by(userId) %>%
  summarize(b_u = mean(rating - muhat - b_i))
```

Now let's see how much the RMSE improves:

```{r}
user_eff_pred <- test_set %>%
  left_join(movie_avgs, by='movieId') %>%
  left_join(user_avgs, by='userId') %>%
  mutate(pred = muhat + b_i + b_u) %>%
  pull(pred)
rmse_user <- RMSE(user_eff_pred, test_set$rating)
rmse_user
results <- results %>% # We add the result to the results database
  add_row(model="Movie + User Effects Model", RMSE=rmse_user)
```

The RMSE in this case is **0.8659736**. This is an improvement, we almost reached our RMSE goal, that was that our RMSE should be at least lower than **0.86549**.

But, we can try to make more improvements by trying more models.

## Penalized least squares {#Regularization}

The general idea of penalized regression is to control the total variability of the movie effects.
Specifically, instead of minimizing the least squares equation, we minimize an equation that adds a penalty:

$$\hat{b_{i}} (\lambda) = \frac{1}{\lambda + n_{i}} \sum_{u=1}^{n_{i}} (Y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu}) $$

Where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $n_i$ is the number of ratings made for movie $i$.
  \item $\lambda$ is the penalty.
  \item $\hat{\mu}$ is the average(mean). 
  \item $b_i$ is the average of $Y_{u,i} - \hat{\mu}$ for each movie $i$.
\end{itemize}

First, we have to identify what model is the one that give us the best results

```{r}
results
```

The best model until now is "[Movie + User Effects Model]{#MUModel}" and this is the model that we are going to use for regularization.

### Penalized Movie + User Effects Model

```{r}
muhat <- mean(train_set$rating) # Average rating of all movies
muhat
```

```{r}
lambdas <- seq(0, 10, 0.5)

# Modeling with Regularized Movie + User Effect Model
rmses_m_u <- sapply(lambdas, function(l){
  # Average rating by movie
  b_i <- train_set %>%
    group_by(movieId) %>%
    summarize(b_i = sum(rating - muhat)/(n()+l))
  # Average rating by user
  b_u <- train_set %>%
    left_join(b_i, by="movieId") %>%
    group_by(userId) %>%
    summarize(b_u = sum(rating - b_i - muhat)/(n()+l))
  # RMSE prediction on the test_set database
  predicted_ratings <-
    test_set %>%
    left_join(b_i, by = "movieId") %>%
    left_join(b_u, by = "userId") %>%
    mutate(pred = muhat + b_i + b_u) %>%
    pull(pred)
  
  return(RMSE(predicted_ratings, test_set$rating))
})
rmse_movie_user_pen <- min(rmses_m_u)
rmse_movie_user_pen
results <- results %>% # We add the result to the results database
  add_row(model="Regularized Movie + User Effect Model", RMSE=rmse_movie_user_pen)
```

The RMSE in this case is **0.8654673**, we've achieve the goal (**RMSE <= 0.86549**). It is very similar at the third model, the [Movie + User Effects Model]{#MUModel}.

```{r}
qplot(lambdas, rmses_m_u)
lambdas[which.min(rmses_m_u)] # The lambda value that minimize the RMSE
```

We can see that the lambda that minimizes the RMSE is **4.5**


## Validation {#Validation}

In this final step, we are going to test the best model until now with the ```validation``` database.

First, we have to identify what model is the one that give us the best results.

```{r}
results
```

We calculate the average rating of all movies in the edx dataset.

```{r muhat_edx}
muhat <- mean(edx$rating) # Average rating of all movies
muhat
```

Finally, we validate the best model with the ```validation``` database.

```{r}
lambdas <- seq(0, 10, 0.1)

# Modeling with Regularized Movie + User Effect Model
rmses_m_u_val <- sapply(lambdas, function(l){
  # Average rating by movie
  b_i <- edx %>%
    group_by(movieId) %>%
    summarize(b_i = sum(rating - muhat)/(n()+l))
  # Average rating by user
  b_u <- edx %>%
    left_join(b_i, by="movieId") %>%
    group_by(userId) %>%
    summarize(b_u = sum(rating - b_i - muhat)/(n()+l))
  # RMSE prediction on the validation database
  predicted_ratings <-
    validation %>%
    left_join(b_i, by = "movieId") %>%
    left_join(b_u, by = "userId") %>%
    mutate(pred = muhat + b_i + b_u) %>%
    pull(pred)
  
  return(RMSE(predicted_ratings, validation$rating))
})
rmse_movie_user_pen_val <- min(rmses_m_u_val)
rmse_movie_user_pen_val
results <- results %>% # We add the result to the results database
  add_row(model="Regularized Movie + User Effect Model Validated", RMSE=rmse_movie_user_pen_val)
```

With this validation, with a RMSE of **0.864817** we've reached our first goal, that was to get at least to **0.86549** 
(RMSE <= **0.86549**), also, in this case, we actually exceed the target of the 
[Capstone course - By HarvardX](https://www.edx.org/es/course/data-science-capstone) 
of **RMSE < 0.86490**.

# Results {#Results}

This is a summary of the results for all the models that we did before, 
trained on ```train_set``` and ```test_set```, and the best model between them, 
it validated in ```edx``` database and ```valitation``` databases.

```{r}
results
```

\newpage
# Final Conclusion {#Conclusion}

After using four different models, we can say that the [```Regularized Movie + User Effect Model```]{#Regularization} gave the best results.
When we validated that model, we can see that the model worked really fine and we exceed our first goal.

Our first goal was that the RMSE should be at least lower than **0.86549** and in the 
[Capstone course - By HarvardX](https://www.edx.org/es/course/data-science-capstone), 
the goal was that the RMSE should be lower than **0.86490**. 
But we got a result of **0.864817**, 
that was the best result obtained based on these models, we've reached the first goal and the Course goal.

The **limitations** in this report is that we used models of predictions until we reached our main goal, however, for **future works** we can allow
us to use more models, like Genre Effect or try to model the movie recommender over years.
